# Problem A : middle number 

## Statement:

Given three number: a,b,c, your task is to order them by value and print their median.      

You will answer **T** distinct test cases: each with different values of **a**, **b** and **c**.

## Input :
The first line contains one integer **T** (1<=T<=1000) indicating the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.

Each test case consists of 3 integer **a** , **b** and **c** separated by a space. 

1<= t <=1000
1<= a <=10^7
1<= b <=10^7
1<= c <=10^7

## Output :
For each test case, output a single integer, the median of the the three number in that test case.       

## Example:
Input 1 :  

```
2 
4 8 3  
6 6 10   
```

Output 1:  

```
4  
6    
```

Input 2:  

```
3
3 1 2
1 50 1000000
69 3 100  
```

Output 2:  

```
2
50
69
```
